# Toolbox

A simple example of how to create a reusable Go module with commonly used tools.

All Kudos go to Trevor!

The included tools are:

- [ ] Read JSON
- [ ] Write JSON
- [ ] Produce a JSON encoded error response
- [X] Upload a file to a specified directory
- [ ] Download a static file
- [X] Get a random string of length n
- [ ] Post JSON to a remote service 
- [ ] Create a directory, including all parent directories, if it does not already exist
- [ ] Create a URL safe slug from a string
